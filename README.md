# Iris-Data-Analysis-ML-Project
This project explores the Iris dataset using Python to understand data patterns and build a machine learning model for flower species classification.
Objective:
To perform exploratory data analysis and build a machine learning model to classify iris flower species.
Approach:
Loaded dataset using pandas
Performed data inspection and cleaning
Conducted exploratory data analysis using matplotlib and seaborn
Trained Logistic Regression model
Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix
Results:
Strong correlation found between petal measurements
Model achieved ~97–100% accuracy
Dataset is well suited for classification
