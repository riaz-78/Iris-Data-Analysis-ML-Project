    "1.  Introduction & Problem Statement:\n",
    "    The objective of this task is to explore and analyze the Iris dataset using Python. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to understand the data distribution, relationships between variables, and build a classification model to predict the species of the flower.\n",

    "2.  Dataset Understanding & Description\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "    iris = pd.read_csv(\"iris.csv\")\n",

    "    iris.shape\n",
    "    iris.info()\n",
    "    iris.describe()\n",
    "It explains:\n",
    "    i. Number of rows and columns\n",
    "    ii. Column names\n",
    "    iii. Data types\n",
    "    iv. Basic statistics\n",
    "The dataset contains 150 observations and 5 features. Four features are numerical and one is categorical(species).\n",

    "3.  Data Cleaning & Preparation\n",
    "    For Iris dataset, cleaning is minimal.\n",

    "Clear separation between species\n",
    "Petal measurements are strong indicators.\n",

    "5.  Model Training & Testing:\n",
    "Now we move to Machine Learning. We’ll use:\n",
    "    . Train/Test Split\n",
    "    . Logistic Regression (simple and professional)\n",
    "Step 1: Prepare Data\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "    X = iris.drop(\"species\", axis=1)\n",
    "    y = iris[\"species\"]\n",
    "    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "Step 2: Train Model\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "    model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)\n",
    "    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "Step 3: Make Predictions\n",
    "    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n",

    "\n",
    "7.  Conclusion:\n",
    "    The Iris dataset was explored and visualized to understand feature relationships. Petal length and petal width were found to be strong predictors of species. A Logistic Regression model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating that the dataset is well-structured for classification tasks."
